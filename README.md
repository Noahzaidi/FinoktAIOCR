# For training capabilities (optional)
pip install -r requirements_training.txt
```

### 2. Start the System

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 3. Open in Browser

Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000`

## 📋 Complete Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow

1. **Upload Documents**
   - Go to `http://localhost:8000/upload`
   - Upload PDF or image files (invoices, receipts, IDs, etc.)
   - Wait for OCR processing to complete

2. **Review and Correct**
   - Click red bounding boxes to edit text
   - Make corrections in the edit panel
   - Save corrections - system learns automatically

3. **Monitor Learning**
   - Check "Learning Stats" tab for progress
   - See auto-corrections applied to new documents
   - Track training data collection

### Document Type Classification

The system automatically detects:
- **Invoices**: Bills, amount due, invoice numbers
- **Receipts**: Purchase confirmations, payment receipts
- **ID Documents**: Passports, driver licenses, IDs
- **Contracts**: Legal agreements, terms and conditions
- **Bank Statements**: Account statements, transaction history

### Data Flow

```
Document Upload → OCR Processing → Bounding Box Overlay →
User Corrections → Lexicon Learning → Training Data Collection →
Future Documents → Auto-Correction → Improved Accuracy
```

## 🎓 Training System

### Current Status

✅ **Working Features:**
- Training sample collection (automatic when corrections are made)
- Lexicon-based auto-corrections (immediate productivity boost)
- Correction logging and analytics
- Training data preparation pipeline

⚠️ **Stub Implementation:**
- Model retraining simulation (collects data but doesn't update OCR model)
- Full PyTorch fine-tuning pipeline (ready for implementation)

### Training Sample Collection

Every correction automatically creates:
- Cropped word image (`.png`)
- Metadata with original → corrected text (`.json`)
- Stored in `data/training_data/ocr_samples/`

**Check your samples:**
```bash
ls data/training_data/ocr_samples/*.png | wc -l
```

### Model Training (Ready for Implementation)

The system includes a complete PyTorch training pipeline:

```bash
# Train model when you have 10+ samples
python train_model.py --epochs 20

# Deploy trained model via UI or CLI
python deploy_model.py deploy best_model.pth
```

## 📊 Testing Guide

### Quick Testing

1. **Start server**: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
2. **Upload document** via web interface
3. **Click bounding boxes** to test correction workflow
4. **Check Learning Stats** tab for progress
5. **Upload similar document** to verify auto-corrections

### Comprehensive Testing

See [TESTING_GUIDE.md](#testing) for detailed scenarios covering:
- Basic OCR and correction flow
- Lexicon learning system
- Document type classification
- Analytics dashboard
- API endpoint testing

## 🚀 Deployment

### Model Deployment

#### UI-Based Deployment (Recommended)
1. Go to document review page
2. Click "Learning Stats" tab
3. Scroll to "Model Deployment" section
4. Click "Deploy" next to desired model

#### CLI-Based Deployment
```bash
# List available models
python deploy_model.py list

# Deploy best model
python deploy_model.py deploy best_model.pth

# Check active model
python deploy_model.py active

# Rollback if needed
python deploy_model.py rollback
```

### Production Considerations

- **Hardware**: GPU recommended for training (CPU works but slower)
- **Storage**: File-based system (consider database for high volume)
- **Monitoring**: Track accuracy improvements and error rates
- **Backup**: Regular backups of training data and models

## 🔧 Configuration

### Training Parameters

```python
# Key training settings
epochs = 20              # Training epochs
batch_size = 16          # Batch size (adjust for GPU memory)
learning_rate = 0.001    # Learning rate
val_ratio = 0.2         # Validation split ratio
device = 'cuda'         # or 'cpu'
```

### System Settings

Configuration managed through `config.json`:
- Document type patterns
- Lexicon learning thresholds
- Training data paths
- Model deployment settings

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bounding boxes not clickable:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Try clicking closer to text center
- Refresh page and try again

**Corrections not saving:**
- Check network tab for failed API calls
- Verify `data/` directory permissions
- Check server logs for errors

**No auto-corrections:**
- Make 3+ identical corrections to trigger learning
- Check Learning Stats for lexicon entries
- Verify document type matches training data

**Training samples not generating:**
- Ensure PIL (Pillow) is installed
- Check `data/training_data/ocr_samples/` permissions
- Verify page images exist in `data/outputs/`

### Debug Tools

```bash
# Check training samples
ls data/training_data/ocr_samples/

# Monitor file creation
find data/ -name "*.png" -o -name "*.json" | head -10

# Check server logs
tail -f /path/to/server.log

# API health check
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
```
