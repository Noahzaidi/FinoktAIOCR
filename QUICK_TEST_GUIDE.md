## ‚úÖ What's Been Improved

### 1. **Better Click Detection**
- Bounding boxes are now much easier to click
- Intelligent ranking finds the best word match
- Progressive tolerance for edge cases

### 2. **Real-Time Text Synchronization**
- When you edit a word, it immediately updates in the Raw OCR Text tab
- All exports use the corrected text
- No more mismatches between views

### 3. **Improved Learning Tab**
- Clear visual cards showing correction statistics
- Better explanations of what each number means
- Professional dashboard-style layout

### 4. **Smart Learning System**
- Configurable threshold (default: 1 correction = auto-learn)
- Visual indicators for auto-corrected words (green boxes)
- Document-type specific learning

## üß™ How to Test

### Step 1: Start the System
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Step 2: Open in Browser
Go to: `http://localhost:8000`

### Step 3: Test Basic Functionality
1. **Upload a document** (PDF or image)
2. **Look for red bounding boxes** around text
3. **Click any red box** - should now work much better!
4. **Edit the text** and click "Save Correction"
5. **Switch to "Raw OCR Text" tab** - should see the correction immediately

### Step 4: Test Learning System
1. **Go to "Smart Learning System" tab**
2. **See the improved dashboard** with clear statistics
3. **Make a correction** and watch the numbers update
4. **Upload a similar document** - should see auto-corrections (green boxes)

## üéØ Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Visual Indicators:
- **Red boxes** = Original OCR text
- **Green boxes** = Auto-corrected by learning system  
- **Blue boxes** = Manually corrected by user

### ‚úÖ Real-Time Updates:
- Corrections immediately appear in Raw OCR Text tab
- Learning statistics update after each correction
- Export data always uses corrected text

### ‚úÖ Smart Learning:
- After 1 correction (configurable), pattern is learned
- Future documents auto-fix the same errors
- Clear feedback about what was learned

## üêõ If Something Doesn't Work

### Bounding Boxes Not Clickable:
1. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
2. **Look for debug messages** showing click coordinates
3. **Try clicking closer to the center** of the text

### Raw Text Not Updating:
1. **Check if correction was saved** (look for "Saved!" message)
2. **Switch between tabs** to refresh the view
3. **Check browser console** for sync errors

### Learning Not Working:
1. **Check Learning Settings** - make sure threshold is set to 1
2. **Make the same correction** on different documents
3. **Check the learning progress cards** for updates

## üìû Quick Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Port already in use**: Kill existing Python processes and restart
- **Import errors**: Make sure all files are saved and server restarted
- **UI not updating**: Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Success Indicators:
- ‚úÖ Red bounding boxes appear on document
- ‚úÖ Clicking boxes opens edit panel
- ‚úÖ Corrections save successfully
- ‚úÖ Raw text updates immediately
- ‚úÖ Learning statistics show progress
